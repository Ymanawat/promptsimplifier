# Project Description:

ProSnapAI is excited to present PromptSimplifier, an app designed to simplify the prompt creation process for writers and artists alike. Our app provides users with a user-friendly UI that offers a variety of helpful options to create a prompt quickly and easily.

With the PromptSimplifier, users can select their desired subject and background, allowing for a personalized and unique prompt creation experience. Our AI-powered backend then takes over, enhancing the prompt using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

Once the prompt has been enhanced, our app generates an image using the stable diffusion Text-to-Image API. This means that users can create a prompt and immediately see a visual representation of it, sparking creativity and inspiration.

## Challenges we faced: 

One of the main challenges we encountered was that we were initially planning to incorporate AI photography into the app, but we were unable to access the GPU resources we needed from AWS. This forced us to pivot our focus and develop the prompt helper feature instead.

Another challenge we faced was ensuring that the app's UI was user-friendly and intuitive. We had to iterate on the design and layout multiple times to make sure that users could easily navigate the app and select the options they needed.

We also faced some technical challenges with integrating the natural language processing and Text-to-Image API components of the app. We had to spend a significant amount of time debugging and testing to ensure that everything was working smoothly and that the prompts generated by the app were of high quality.

Despite these challenges, we are proud of what we have achieved with PromptSimplifier and are excited to present it at Stranger Hacks: GPT Era.
